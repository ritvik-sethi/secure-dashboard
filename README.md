## Project Overview
This project is an authentication application built using React with TypeScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. The application allows users to sign up, log in, and access a protected dashboard, all while utilizing a simple text file as a user database.

## Features

### Frontend
- **Redux/Toolkit**: Utilized for efficient state management across the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Implemented for responsive and modern styling.
- **Axios**: Used for making API requests to the backend.
- **Middleware Support**: Implemented for protecting routes during login.
- **Testing**: Utilized Jest and React Testing Library (RTL) for unit and integration testing.

### Backend
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Used to create a RESTful API for user authentication.
- **fs Module**: Used for reading and writing user data to a text file, which is treated as the database.
